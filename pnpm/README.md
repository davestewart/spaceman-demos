# Spaceman PNPM demo

## Intro

This repo is designed to show compatibility with PNPM workspaces.

The code was forked from the Turborepo [PNPM example](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/with-pnpm) which should provide a production-level setup to test any Spaceman modifications.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```
npm i 
```

Run spaceman, and attempt a task:

```
spaceman
```
